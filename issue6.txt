ISSUE6 LEVIATHAN OVERTHEWIRE.org

current :: leviathan5

this level gave me a headache... but first and foremost see is there is any file existi-
-ng /tmp/file.log bcz it mustn't coz binary is gonna use it

this binary reads data from /tmp/file.log as leviathan6 so just create a symbolic link
of /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 to /tmp/file.log

then run the binary.
