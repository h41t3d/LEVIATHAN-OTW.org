current :: leviathan2 

first level on which it felt like real hacking.. lol

here we have a setuid binary, this binary prints the file which satisfies the permissio-
-ns..

ltrace a file that can be accessed by the binary.... {/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2}
it shows that "/bin/cat %s" access the file and this is ecploitable as... in "c" line 
terminator is ";" so file name containing a ";" followed with bash can do the work.

make a tmp dir and a file nano "<anything>;bash" and do 
/home/leviathan2/printfile "<anything>;bash"

which gives a bash for leviathan3.. why bcz the owner for setuid binary is leviathan3
